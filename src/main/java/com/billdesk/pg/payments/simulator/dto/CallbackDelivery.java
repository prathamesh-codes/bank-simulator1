/**
 * What to send the browser back to on the callback/return leg, and how to fire the matching S2S
 * call to the same URL (design doc §2/§3.1's "how each bank redirects back" — for HRE, a 302 to
 * the captured DynamicUrl with these as query params, per HRE.md §2's sequence diagram; open
 * question §10.3 flags this transport as worth confirming against the real api-side handler
 * before treating it as final). The HTTP method for the S2S leg is bank-declared here rather than
 * hardcoded in the generic delivery code, so a bank whose S2S call isn't a plain GET can say so
 * without any change outside its own plugin.
